# intro
Good.

#Making data files 
Good. Unclear the necessity of setting SNP_IDs as rownames. May be clear later.

##Getting the file info
Good.

## Inspecting fang dataset
Fine. Redundant to call dim() and then also nrow() and ncol().

#The inpection indicates that
Good.

##Inspecting snp dataset
Fine. Redundant to call dim() and then also nrow() and ncol().

## The inspection indicates that there are 983 rows and 15 columns in the snp_position file
Good. Summaries more useful anyway.

## Extracting maize sequences
Good.

#Transposing maize data
Good.

#Removing 2nd and 3rd columns of maize and teosinte
Good.

#Merging maize and teosinte files
Verbose, but fits purpose. Would've liked to see more description of merge method, but code is clear enough.

# Decreasing order of maize genotypes
Verbose, but fits purpose.

# Subsetting teosinte file based on individual chr 1-10 & arranging in decreasing order of position
Verbose, but fits purpose. This is the same code as the one labeled "Merging maize and teosinte files", but has a very differnet label. Better commenting would be nicer, but that's not a reflection on whether the code works.

# Subsetting maize file based on individual chr 1-10 & arranging in decreasing order of position
Same deal as above.

#Data Visualization
No comments. 
Ergo, no comment. 
(I don't really know what it's supposed to do, sorry.)

# File for plotting SNPs per chromosome
Good.

# View(File_plot_count)
# Plotting SNPs per chromosome 
Good.

# Subsetting file for plotting distribution of SNPs on chromosomes
# PLotting distribution of SNPs on chromosomes
Very good. Above and beyond the specs, which only asked for a plot of number of SNPs, e.g. bar graph. Code was verbose, but seems to fit purpose.

# SUMMARY REVEIW #
##################

Reviewee's code was very verbose, but seemed to fit purpose. Reviewee did not do the parts of the assignment pertaining to heterozygosity. (This reviewer is guilty of that too, to be fair.) Plot showing the precise distribution of SNPs across the chromosome went above and beyond the specifications, which I appreciated.
